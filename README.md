# OpenCart-Disable Payment Method If Ship Method(Radio Buttons)
In this example we use  the change function of jQuery to locate a change in a set of classes (Radio Buttons)
If a change occurs, we check if a specific radio button is selected, if yes we disable another radio button,
if not the radio button remains enabled.

Tip: To select a specific radio button we have to select its name and value (at least it didn't work otherwise for me)
